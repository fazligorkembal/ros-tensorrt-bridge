# ROS-TensorRT Bridge
### A bridge between ROS (Robot Operating System) and NVIDIA TensorRT for high-performance deep learning inference in robotics applications. This repository provides tools and interfaces to efficiently deploy TensorRT-optimized models in ROS environments, enabling real-time AI inference with low latency.

## 🚀 Features:
- ### 🤖 ROS2 (Humble/Iron) integration for deployment of TensorRT-accelerated models.
- ### 🖥️ Cross-platform: Supports Jetson (ARM64) and x86_64 (AMD64) architectures.
- ### 🐳 Docker-ready: Pre-configured containers for easy deployment on supported devices.

### 💡 Use Cases: Autonomous robots, industrial perception, real-time sensor processing.
